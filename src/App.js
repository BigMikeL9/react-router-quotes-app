         ðŸ›‘âœ‹ 
         DONT add 'exact' prop when we have a nested Routes. ie: in '<QuoteDetail />' would have a nested Route ðŸ‘‡

          <Route path={`/quotes/${params.quoteId}/comments`} exact>
            <Comments />
          </Route> 

          The reason is that once you put 'exact' on the outer portion of a nested path it can no longer reach that nested path since it is not exact. So in your case above it will not even enter the <QuoteDetail /> , so it definitely will not reach <Comments /> which is nested inside <QuoteDetail /> .
